'''
Excercise 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
'''

def exercise1():
    from datetime import datetime # we will use this to get the year
    currentYear = datetime.now().year # Gets the current year so program does not have to be updated each year using datetime

    name = input("Enter Name: ").title() # putting input in title form so first letter will be capitalized
    age = input(" Enter Age: ")
    turning_100 = ((currentYear - int(age) + 100)) # Current Year - Age = Year of Birth -- Add 100 for 100 years after the year of birth
    print("Hello, " + name + "! You will turn 100 years old in the year " + str(turning_100) + "!") #output

'''
Exercise 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
'''

def exercise2():
    try:

        num = int(input("Enter a positive number: ")) # Convert numerical input from a string to an integer

        if num % 2 == 0:
            print("The number " + str(num) + " is even!")
        else:
            print("The number " + str(num) +  " is odd!")

    except ValueError: # Will be called if user inputs a non-integer value
        print("Please enter an integer.")

'''
Exercise 3
Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
'''

def exercise3():
    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

    for num in a:
        if num < 5:
            print(num)

    # [output] for [item] in [list] if [filter] LIST COMPREHENSION

    print([num for num in a if num < 5]) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3]



'''
Exercise 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
(If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

'''

def exercise4():

    num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) # Input: 21
    print([div for div in range(1, num + 1) if num % div == 0]) # Output: [1, 3, 7, 21]


'''
Exercise 5
Write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
 Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
'''

def exercise5():
    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
    b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

    print([item for item in a and b if item in a and b]) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

'''
Exercise 6
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. 
(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
'''
def exercise6():
    string = input("Enter a word or message: ")
    string_reverse = string[::-1]
    print(string_reverse)
    if string == string_reverse:
        print(string + " is a palindrome.")
    else:
        print(string + " is not a palindrome.")

    # test = "Chris Brown" input: Chris Brown
    # print(test[0:7:]) output: Chris B

'''
Exercise 7
Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
'''

def exercise7():
    a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
    print([even for even in a if even % 2 == 0])

    print("Even") ; print( "Numbers!") #Did not know until today you could use semi-colons in Python :0 8/7/2019
 
 '''
Exercise 11
Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.).
You can (and should!) use your answer to Exercise 4 to help you. Take this opportunity to practice using functions, described below.
'''

def exercise11():
    import sympy

    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    prime = sympy.isprime(number)

    if prime: #if True, print 'Prime'
        print("Prime")
    else:
        print("Not Prime")

def exercise11_1(x):
    
    if x > 1:
        for i in range(2, x):
            print(i)
            if x % i == 0: #prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself, when something is divisible by a number greater than one, it's remainder is 0 

                print("Not Prime")
                return False
        print("Prime")
        return True

    print("Not prime")
    return False
